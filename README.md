# Problem 1 :
Write a function or procedure that allows you to enter today's date and then asks for the person's name.
If this name = Ahmed, there is a display of "Welcome Ahmed" then asks him for his birthday and compares it to today's date.
If it is the same, there is a display of "Happy Birthday Ahmed" otherwise there is a "person error!".
# Problem 2 :
Write a function or procedure that solves a quadratic equation.
# Problem 3 :
Description :
Given two sets of elements, find the sum of all distinct elements from the set . In other words , find the sum of all elements which are present in either of the giver set.
Example : 
- SET 1 : [ 3 , 1 , 7 , 9] and SET 2 : [ 2 , 4 , 1 , 9 , 3]
- Output : 13 ( distinct elements : 4 , 7 , 2 )
Give two solution to this problem using a different type of loops each time.
Now given two sets of integers,write also two algorithms to print to print the sum of overlapping elements in two sets . The elements in each set are unique or there are no duplicates within a set 
Example : 
- SET 1 : [ 12 , 13 , 6 , 10]
- SET 2 : [13 , 10 , 16 , 15 ]
- SUM of overlapping elements : 46
- Explanation  :Common elements are 10 , 13
